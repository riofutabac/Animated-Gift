# Animated Gift Box and Flowers

This project is a single HTML file containing all the necessary CSS and JavaScript to display an animated gift box and flowers. The animations are designed to be easily viewed in any modern web browser without needing any additional installations or dependencies.

## Description

The project features an animated gift box and flowers in shades of blue. It includes two specific sections where users can insert their own images of the gift and the flowers. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use and customizable animation that can be integrated into various projects.

## Usage

1. **No Additional Installations Required**: You only need a web browser to view and use this project.
2. **Customization**: You can replace the images of the gift and flowers by modifying the corresponding sections in the HTML code.
3. **Message Insertion**: To change the displayed messages, look for the section in the JavaScript where it states `INSERTAR-MENSAJE` and replace it with your desired text.
